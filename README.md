# TimeSlotFinder
Python programm to find free timeslots of meeting participants

A common requirement for businesses is finding applicable timeslots for all meeting participants.
This is not a trivial thing to do as many participants already have meetings during the desired times.
TimeSlotFinder uses all existing meetings of all participants to calculate a timeslot where all prticipants are free.
